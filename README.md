https://www.kaggle.com/rgupta09/kiva-exploration-n-poverty-analysis

Implemented in Python as part of Kaggle’s “Data Science for Good: Kiva Crowdfunding” challenge, this project identifies key economic and demographic factors for assessing poverty levels of Kiva’s loan borrowers.
- With 64% of borrowers from Medium Human Development & Lower Middle Income levels, 72% were from countries with a High GDP
- Distinct patterns in the use of loans segregating borrowers from differing economic strata divulged from the analysis


Includes analyses & visualizations on the community & geographic level portraying the demographics on a world-scale, including poverty related modeling illustrating the correlation of loans and poverty, while depicting the diverse network of lenders to borrowers
